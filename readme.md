## Concordia Buyer Agent Project

This repository contains an **AI-powered buyer agent** built with Google DeepMind's Concordia framework. The agent negotiates for perishable goods (such as mangoes) against an intelligent seller, aiming to maximize savings, maintain personality consistency, and close deals efficiently.

## üì¶ Submission Files

- **buyer_agent.py**  
  Core Python implementation of the Concordia-based buyer agent, including negotiation policy, memory, personality component, and testing routines.

- **personality_config.json**  
  JSON definition of your agent‚Äôs core traits, negotiation style, and communication catchphrases.

- **strategy.md**  
  One-page markdown document explaining your agent‚Äôs negotiation strategy, rationale for personality, decision logic, and insights from testing.

- **requirements.txt**  
  List of Python package dependencies required to run the agent.

## üöÄ Quickstart

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>
```

### 2. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure you have the Concordia framework and sentence-transformers installed.

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
python buyer_agent.py                # Runs built-in test scenarios with conversation output
python buyer_agent.py --silent       # Runs tests with minimal output
python buyer_agent.py --single       # Run an interactive single negotiation
python buyer_agent.py --debug        # Run performance benchmarks
python buyer_agent.py --model llama3 # Choose LLM model (default: llama3:8b)
```

## üß† Project Overview

- **Concordia Framework:**  
  Used for composable agent components, memory, personality management, and context-aware negotiation.

- **Agent Personality:**  
  Defined in personality_config.json and embedded in all negotiation messages for consistency.

- **Negotiation Strategy:**  
  - Anchors opening offers strategically below market price
  - Uses adaptive concession logic as rounds progress
  - Accepts fair deals quickly
  - Tracks whole negotiation via memory
  - Never exceeds buyer budget

- **LLM Integration:**  
  Generates dialogue in context, maintaining character and adapting to seller moves.
