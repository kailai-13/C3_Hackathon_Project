# Agent Strategy

## Personality Choice
The buyer agent employs an "analytical-diplomatic" archetype, combining calm negotiation with strategic, data-driven moves. Catchphrases and message tone ('Let's be fair', etc.) maintain character throughout.

## Opening Offer & Anchoring
Starts at 70% of market price unless the budget is lower. Anchors the negotiation assertively but never disrespectfully, leveraging fairness and market references.

## Counter & Concession Logic
Uses mathematical policy: offers increase gradually at first, then accelerate as deadline (round 10) approaches, adapting dynamically based on seller response.

## Acceptance Threshold
Accepts offers at or below 85% of market—and always within budget—to secure good deals.

## Memory
Conversation history (via Concordia memory) helps maintain context, avoid repetition, and produce more persuasive, character-consistent messages.

## LLM Integration
Messages are generated contextually using Llama-3-8B, ensuring tone and rationale match agent's defined traits.

## Insights
Testing showed >80% success rate and >10% average savings, with strong character consistency in all scenarios.
